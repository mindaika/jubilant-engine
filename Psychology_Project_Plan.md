# Psychology-Focused AI/ML-Powered Application Development Plan

## **Goal**
Build a web-based application that uses machine learning to analyze psychological data, predict patterns, and visualize results. The application will also include a robust **data science and analytics** component, allowing users to explore and analyze psychological datasets through interactive data visualization.

## **Project Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Planning and Research (Week 1)**
1. **Define Scope:**
   - Decide on the main functionality (e.g., sentiment analysis, behavior prediction, survey data analysis).
   - Identify target users (e.g., psychologists, researchers, students).
2. **Dataset Collection:**
   - Locate open-source datasets:
     - [Open Psychology Dataset](https://openpsychometrics.org/data/)
     - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
     - Text sentiment datasets like IMDB Reviews or Twitter Sentiment Analysis.
   - Ensure datasets are compatible with planned data science workflows.
3. **Tool Selection:**
   - Programming Language: Python (for ML, data science, and backend).
   - Frameworks:
     - Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
     - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly/Dash.
     - Backend: Flask, FastAPI.
   - Database: MariaDB (MySQL-compatible) for storing datasets and results.

### **Phase 2: Setting Up the Environment (Week 2)**
1. **Hardware and Software Setup:**
   - Install Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, MariaDB, Flask/FastAPI, and Plotly/Dash.
   - Configure your Synology NAS to host services:
     - Enable Docker for deployment.
     - Set up a subdomain for hosting the web app.
2. **Project Structure:**
   - Set up GitHub/GitLab repository.
   - Create folders for `data`, `models`, `analytics`, `scripts`, `frontend`, and `backend`.

---

### **Phase 3: Data Preparation and Exploration (Weeks 3–4)**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Use Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess datasets.
   - Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize datasets using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract useful features for behavior prediction or sentiment analysis (e.g., word embeddings for text data).

---

### **Phase 4: Model Development (Weeks 5–6)**
1. **Model Selection:**
   - For behavior prediction: Use regression, decision trees, or neural networks.
   - For sentiment analysis: Fine-tune pre-trained models like BERT using Hugging Face Transformers.
2. **Model Training:**
   - Train models using your Radeon RX 7600 for GPU acceleration.
   - Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, or ROC-AUC.

---

### **Phase 5: Data Science and Visualization (Weeks 7–8)**
1. **Data Analytics:**
   - Create statistical summaries and insights from the psychological datasets.
   - Use libraries like Pandas and SciPy to perform advanced statistical analysis.
2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Build interactive dashboards using Plotly/Dash for data exploration.
   - Create visualizations for:
     - Survey responses (e.g., histograms, bar charts).
     - Sentiment trends (e.g., line graphs).
     - Behavior predictions (e.g., scatter plots, heatmaps).
3. **Integration with Frontend:**
   - Embed dashboards and charts into the frontend using Flutter widgets for seamless interaction.

---

### **Phase 6: Backend and Frontend Development (Weeks 9–10)**
1. **Backend Development:**
   - Use Flask or FastAPI to create an API for model inference and analytics.
   - Endpoints:
     - `/predict`: Accepts input data and returns predictions.
     - `/upload`: Allows users to upload new datasets.
     - `/analytics`: Provides processed data and visualizations.
2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Learn and use **Dart with Flutter** for a modern, cross-platform UI.
   - Build forms for input, visualizations for results, and interactive charts using Flutter's built-in support for web and desktop.

---

### **Phase 7: Integration and Deployment (Weeks 11–12)**
1. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test the entire system: frontend, backend, data analytics, and model predictions.
   - Use Postman or similar tools to test API endpoints.
2. **Deployment:**
   - Use Docker to containerize the application.
   - Deploy it on your Synology NAS:
     - Host the frontend and backend on a subdomain.
     - Set up HTTPS using Let's Encrypt.
   - Configure the NAS for secure remote access.

---

### **Phase 8: Finalization and Enhancements (Weeks 13–14)**
1. **Documentation:**
   - Create user guides and developer documentation.
   - Include examples of input/output, analytics workflows, and deployment instructions.
2. **User Feedback:**
   - Share with psychologists or colleagues for feedback.
   - Identify areas for improvement or additional features.
3. **Enhancements:**
   - Add advanced features, such as dynamic filtering of visualizations or new analytics modules.
   - Optimize performance and scalability.

---

### **Stretch Goals (Months 4–6)**
